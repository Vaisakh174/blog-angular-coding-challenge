                    <h4>WHAT IS MEAN STACK DEVELOPMENT</h4>

                    <p>What is MEAN stack development? Is it the same as full-stack development? What are the core
                        technologies of the MEAN stack? What is the salary of a MEAN stack developer? In the article,
                        you’ll
                        find explicit answers to these questions. We’ve looked into the advantages and disadvantages of
                        the
                        MEAN stack. So, keep reading to find out whether it’s worth implementing this approach for your
                        project.</p>
                    <p>The IT world changes fast, and it’s crucial for developers to stay up to date with the
                        technologies
                        they choose for the projects. That’s why there is such a concept as a technology stack. It is a
                        set
                        of languages and tools combined to deliver the best development results and high application
                        performance. For each project, you need to build the client and the server sides and integrate a
                        database. The main trait of a successful tech stack is that the technologies for each part
                        interact
                        with each other well. The thing is, some databases don’t support some languages. For example, if
                        you
                        write the app’s backend with C#, you cannot implement a PostgreSQL database. There are numerous
                        stack options that aim at different purposes and have various advantages and disadvantages.
                        Today,
                        we will talk about the MEAN stack, which is widely used for web development. We’ll discuss why
                        it is
                        now dominating the world of web development and why it is worth becoming a MEAN stack developer.
                    </p>

                    <p>The title “MEAN” is formed with the first letters of each of four technologies lying in its
                        basis.
                    </p>
                    <img src="https://existek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-1.png" alt="">
                    <p>These frameworks and tools cover all development aspects – database, frontend, and backend. In
                        the
                        case of MEAN stack development, these technologies are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>MongoDB</li>
                        <li>Express.js</li>
                        <li>Angular</li>
                        <li>Node.js</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Until recent years, the “A” letter of the MEAN abbreviation stood for Angular.js. However, at the
                        very end of 2021, Google will stop the support of Angular.js and replace it with Angular 2.0+,
                        which
                        is based on TypeScript instead of JavaScript. So, traditionally, when someone mentioned the MEAN
                        stack, they meant a set of technologies entirely based on JavaScript. Still, in this article,
                        we’ll
                        replace Angular.js with Angular and describe how it affects development.</p>
                    <p>What distinguishes this technology set is that it’s wholly based on JavaScript (apart from
                        Angular
                        based on TypeScript), which is incredibly beneficial for several reasons. First of all,
                        JavaScript
                        has been taking first place on the ratings of the most popular technologies for years. Almost
                        70% of
                        professional developers choose this language over the others. Its main advantage is that due to
                        the
                        numerous frameworks, it allows using it on the front end as well as on the back end.

                        Such popularity of JavaScript means that if you’re looking for a MEAN stack developer for your
                        project, there’s a strong possibility that the learning curve will be very smooth, so the
                        programmers will be able to get to work quickly. We’ll look into MEAN stack benefits later in
                        the
                        article, and for now, let’s discuss the technologies used in it.</p>
                    <h4>MongoDB</h4>
                    <p>We’ll start with the database. In some sense, it’s the core part of any application because it
                        stores
                        all the necessary data used by the software. That’s why it’s worth paying particular attention
                        to
                        the characteristics of the used database system.

                        In the MEAN stack, M stands for MongoDB as the database solution. MongoDB is a NoSQL database.
                        NoSQL
                        databases store data differently compared to relational tables. NoSQL stands for “not only SQL,”
                        and
                        it is a more flexible approach. They allow using graphs, key-value relationships, wide-column,
                        or
                        document type, while SQL databases deal only with tables.

                        Some people think that NoSQL databases are unsuitable for large projects, but they can handle a
                        very
                        high load if adequately organized. Their most significant advantage is that you can amend
                        changes on
                        the go and add new features quickly as the application grows due to the data models.

                        Also, NoSQL databases, and especially, MongoDB can be much faster in comparison to their SQL
                        competitors. The thing is, in SQL databases, all tables are interconnected, and queries for a
                        single
                        object require joins from all connected tables. Whereas in NoSQL databases, data is stored in a
                        form
                        optimized for queries so that you receive results faster.

                        Another significant benefit of MongoDB as a NoSQL database is that it maps its data structures
                        the
                        same way as in particular programming languages. So, it saves lots of coding time and decreases
                        the
                        frequency of bugs’ occurrence.</p>
                    <img src="https://existek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3-1.png" alt="">
                    <p>MongoDB is a cross-platform database system built in C++. It stores data in key-value pairs. It
                        is
                        document-based, meaning that fields may vary from document to document. A good analogy of a
                        document
                        in MongoDB would be an object in the OOP approach. MongoDB doesn’t require updating the whole
                        table
                        when you add a new value, and it leads to noticeable time savings and easy data storage for
                        large
                        projects. It’s worth highlighting that JavaScript is all you need to know to handle MongoDB.

                        MongoDB has numerous upsides, especially regarding large projects and high loads, but we should
                        say
                        that it is not a great option in terms of data integrity because compared to RDBMS, in MongoDB,
                        it
                        is not a requirement.

                        When we’ve figured out essential information about MongoDB, it’s time to move to the next
                        technology
                        in the MEAN stack – Express.js.</p>
                    <h4>Express.js</h4>
                    <p>Express.js is a reliable server web framework for Node.js. Developers use it for single,
                        multi-page,
                        and hybrid web applications and APIs. Its primary purpose is to handle HTTP requests, such as
                        GET or
                        DELETE. It’s possible to achieve with just Node.js, but in this case, you’ll need to write your
                        own
                        code for it. To avoid such time spendings, Node.js introduces a flexible Express.js framework.
                        It is
                        also built with JavaScript, and you don’t need to know other languages to use it.</p>
                    <img src="https://existek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4-1.png" alt="">
                    <p>The Pug engine lies at the heart of Express.js. It is the most widely used templating framework.
                        It
                        provides template support, which leads to dynamic HTML page rendering.

                        As for the pros and cons of Express.js, the first thing we would like to highlight is extremely
                        fast
                        Input/Output, which is highly important for server-side technology. It is asynchronous and uses
                        an
                        MVC (Model-View-Controller).

                        Let’s say a word about how this framework works. Primarily, it was used for creating RESTful
                        APIs
                        that allow receiving the request from the frontend, sending it to the backend, and returning the
                        appropriate response. It describes the MEAN stack architecture shortly, but we’ll look into it
                        in
                        more detail later in the article.As for some more obvious Express.js advantages, it has a
                        wonderful
                        open-source community where developers contribute and give feedback on the code. It can be
                        beneficial for aspiring and professional developers. Also, it is the most supported Node.js
                        framework. That’s why it’s constantly updated, and bugs are fixed immediately if there are any.

                        The event-driven callback nature is among the disadvantages of this part of the MEAN stack. It’s
                        not
                        harmful itself, but it can be very challenging for those programmers who are used to
                        async/await.
                        Instead of diving deep into the callback nature and figuring out how it works, they may write
                        all
                        code in callbacks, which makes the app almost impossible to maintain in the future.</p>
                    <h4>Angular</h4>
                    <p>Till December 31st, Angular.js existed as a reliable JavaScript framework created and maintained
                        by
                        Google. However, due to some problems in architecture, Google hasn’t updated it with new
                        features
                        approximately since 2018. It received only security updates and critical features. In 2016, the
                        Angular team in Google decided to rewrite Angular.js into Angular almost completely without
                        backward
                        compatibility and provide further enhancements to Angular instead of Angular.js. The New Angular
                        version is based on TypeScript. It is open-source as well as the other technologies of the MEAN
                        stack. Its most potent characteristic is that it uses the MVC architecture. MVC stands for
                        Model-View-Controller. It is a pattern that divides all application logic into three components.
                        The
                        main goal of MVC is to separate the input from data processing and output. The model handles the
                        data logic. The view is responsible for how the user interacts with an app, and the controller
                        regulates the interaction of both components with the user. In simpler words, the controller
                        receives the information from the user, transfers it to the model, which processes it, and
                        passes it
                        to the view that displays it visually.</p>
                    <img src="https://existek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/5-1.png" alt="">
                    <p>One of the most significant advantages of the MVC model is the increased development speed. With
                        the
                        MVC, developers can simultaneously work on different app parts. While one dev is working with
                        the
                        visual presentation, the other may work with the business logic and set up the controller.
                        Another
                        reason for faster development with the MVC is that when one part is modified, the others remain
                        unchanged. It is crucial for web applications because the user interface tends to change
                        frequently.

                        Angular fully supports all HTML syntax and uses it as the primary templating language. So, devs
                        can
                        express the components according to HTML rules. You may want to ask why it is not enough to use
                        plain HTML then? Well, it’s a great declarative language, but compared to Angular, it has a very
                        restricted set of opportunities.

                        Angular has a lot of useful libraries and frameworks for different app types. Besides, it
                        contains
                        all the necessary features of an advanced client-side language: deep linking, data binding,
                        testability story, reusable components, etc.

                        If we step away from the technical details a bit, we should mention the constant release of
                        updates
                        and excellent community support.

                        The reliability of this web framework is proved by the list of companies that use it:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Amazon</li>
                        <li>Nike</li>
                        <li>HBO</li>
                        <li>Google</li>
                        <li>Forbes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Node.js</h4> Some people call Node.js a framework, but in fact, it is a running environment
                    meaning
                    that its primary purpose is to execute JavaScript code from outside of the browser. It is used for
                    building web servers and applications.

                    Node.js has completely changed the world of web development. Such popular front-end frameworks as
                    Bootstrap, Angular, and others were released a long time ago, but the back-end development was
                    always a
                    more complicated task. However, with the launch of Node.js, it became possible to create server-side
                    applications with JavaScript.
                    <img src="https://existek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-1.png" alt="">
                    <p>Node.js uses the event-driven non-blocking I/O model, making it a perfect candidate for
                        applications
                        that process vast amounts of data and perform numerous tasks simultaneously. Event-driven I/O
                        works
                        like this: while one task is being processed in the background, Node.js receives the next one
                        and
                        immediately starts working on it. Moreover, such an operation doesn’t require a significant
                        amount
                        of CPU.

                        Node.js has proven itself excellent for real-time web apps. It has high performance because it
                        was
                        initially designed for optimizing the scalability of apps and their capacity.

                        In addition, you may find NPM (Node.js package manager) very useful, especially if you’re
                        working
                        with a tremendous amount of code. It unites some parts of the code in modules so that Node.js
                        can
                        handle dependency conflicts quickly and effectively.

                        Since we’re talking about large amounts of data, we should mention the dashboarding in Node.js.
                        HTTP
                        requests handling are among its features, and HTTP requests are large files streams. Node.js
                        uses
                        GraphQL for visualizing data.

                        As you can see, Node.js allows developers to perform some tasks that are impossible with some
                        other
                        environments. It also uses the V8 engine considered the fastest one for JavaScript.

                        Well, now, when we’ve figured out the essential information about all parts of the MEAN stack,
                        let’s
                        proceed to the advantages and disadvantages of this set of technologies.
                    </p>
                    <h4>MEAN STACK DEVELOPMENT: PROS AND CONS</h4>
                    <p>Like any concept, MEAN stack development has its pros and cons. We’re going to look into its
                        strengths and weaknesses in terms of web development.

                        First off, let’s start with the JavaScript and TypeScript being the core languages of the whole
                        stack. The popularity of these technologies is the most obvious advantage in this case. The huge
                        number of developers already knowing them leads to a smooth learning curve. So, the chances that
                        you’ll easily find a specialist who can quickly start working with the MEAN stack are very high.

                        Moreover, we should point out the compilation. TypeScript that lies at the core of Angular,
                        needs to
                        compile the code, unlike JavaScript. It means that the code should be translated to pure
                        JavaScript
                        before running it. The compilation usually takes just a few seconds. Though it may seem like a
                        waste
                        of time in terms of a large project, it saves hours and days that would otherwise be spent on
                        testing and debugging. The thing is, when the code it’s compiled, numerous runtime errors
                        appear.
                        Consequently, if even the smallest bug isn’t found and fixed, it may lead to the application
                        crashing. So, a few-second time for compilation is more of an advantage rather than a downside.

                        Though, to be fair, we should say that many practices are allowing us to avoid runtime errors.
                        For
                        example, one should not use uninitialized variables, check memory limits, check the bounds of
                        the
                        arrays, etc.</p>
                    <p>The MEAN stack development tends to be relatively quick because of the two technologies lying in
                        its
                        core: TypeScript and JavaScript. The first one has optional dynamic and static typing, but
                        Express.js and Node.js, based on JavaScript, have only dynamic typing. The world of developers
                        is
                        divided into two camps. Some think that dynamic typing is more of a disadvantage than an upside
                        because if there are no strictly defined guidelines, it leads to numerous bugs. However, it may
                        save
                        lots of time due to the simpler code.

                        We should mention the fact that MEAN is entirely open-source. It means that all components are
                        free,
                        and developers can access public repositories and libraries at any time.

                        Speaking of publicly accessible code, let’s talk a bit about the community. Though the
                        technologies
                        of the MEAN stack are relatively new, they got trusted and reliable. According to this, many
                        developers have worked with them for a long time. So, if you have a challenging situation with
                        the
                        code, there’s a great chance that somebody has already encountered the problem that you’re
                        having.
                        So that it’s easy to find answers to your questions and, consequently, create an application
                        without
                        numerous errors.

                        Cost-effectiveness is also a considerable advantage in terms of MEAN stack development. From the
                        business perspective, hiring one MEAN stack developer is much more beneficial than four
                        specialists,
                        each of whom will work on one application part only. Apart from budget savings, development time
                        is
                        also reduced because devs won’t have to spend it communicating with each other and establishing
                        something.

                        Cloud solutions have gained more and more popularity in recent years for several reasons. First
                        of
                        all, accessibility from all devices is a great pro. Cloud apps are excellent for enterprises
                        because
                        it guarantees that all employees are working with the same app version at any moment.
                        Considering
                        this, we should highlight MongoDB as the significant upside. It is a NoSQL database program that
                        is
                        built for the cloud.</p>
                    <p>However, there is a disadvantage related to MongoDB. It is oriented toward small and medium-sized
                        projects, but it might not be the best choice if we’re talking about enterprises.

                        As for the other cons of MEAN stack development, we should mention JavaScript again. Though it
                        is
                        the most popular programming language, it is sometimes a bit more flexible than it might be, and
                        in
                        particular cases, it may lead to angled code that is difficult to document.

                        The last significant downside is the poor isolation of the app’s business logic from the server
                        operations.</p>
                    <img src="https://existek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/8-1.png" alt="">
                    <h4>MEAN STACK ARCHITECTURE</h4>
                    <p>As we already know, the MEAN stack includes four technologies – Node.js, Express.js, Angular, and
                        MongoDB. Each of them is responsible for particular processes. Let’s discuss it in more detail.

                        It will be easier to understand the functions of each part of the MEAN stack if we present it
                        visually. So, let’s look at the scheme below.</p>
                    <img src="https://existek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7-1.png" alt="">
                    <p>For now, let’s proceed from point to point. Angular is the first thing a user communicates with.
                        When
                        the request is sent, it reaches Angular at once. So, this framework’s goal is to receive
                        requests
                        from users on the frontend, send them to Node.js, and when the cycle goes through all the other
                        phases, Angular returns the response to the user.

                        So, Angular sends requests to Node.js to handle it later. When Node.js receives the request, it
                        will
                        parse it and send it to Express.js. Node.js is the central part of the MEAN stack. It is the
                        core
                        part that handles the requests between client and server.

                        The next component is Express.js. It implies the APIs, which are used for accessing the
                        database.
                        So, Express.js uses a particular API to call the database, depending on whether a user wants to
                        store or fetch the data.

                        When MongoDB receives a request from Express.js, it handles it and returns the response.

                        Express.js returns it to Node.js, which handles it, and sends it to Angular. In the end, Angular
                        displays the data fetched from the MongoDB database to the user.</p>
                    <h4>MEAN STACK DEVELOPER SALARY</h4>
                    <p>Now, when we’ve figured out what is MEAN stack, and how it works precisely, let’s see what job
                        opportunities there are and what the MEAN stack developer salary is.

                        It’s rather difficult to name the exact salary of a particular specialist because it will vary
                        significantly depending on the world region and one’s professional experience. However, let’s
                        take
                        the United States as the ground zero. If we consider the middle MEAN stack developer, we will
                        have
                        an average salary accounting for about $125K per year, according to Glassdoor. Of course, for a
                        junior developer, the number will constitute about $75K yearly, and on the opposite, a senior
                        developer can expect a $200K annual salary.

                        Undoubtedly, the United States is probably the most expensive world region in terms of
                        development
                        rates. Although the quality of the provided services is fully in line with the prices, sometimes
                        the
                        budget doesn’t allow for outsourcing to the US.

                        If you still want the highest quality but for a lower price, you may consider outsourcing to
                        Europe.
                        Numerous countries provide excellent development services. Among all, we would like to point out
                        Ukraine, which is the leading outsourcing destination in Eastern Europe.

                        If we scroll through different ratings related to software development, we will find Ukraine in
                        most
                        of them. So, global recognition is the first noticeable advantage of Ukraine as an outsourcing
                        destination.

                        The development community in Ukraine is also highly active. There are numerous large and small
                        groups of developers that hold meetings, conferences, etc. Among the most popular events, there
                        are
                        Lviv IT Arena, and IForum.

                        Moreover, a great deal of attention is paid to technical education. Yearly, more than 20k
                        students
                        graduate from technical universities. Also, we should mention the modern approach in education
                        that
                        provides the possibility to learn the latest technologies and gain the knowledge of using them
                        in
                        real life.

                        For now, let’s focus more on the numbers, and see what salaries MEAN stack developers can expect
                        in
                        Ukraine. DOU held a survey that showed many interesting facts about the IT industry in Ukraine.
                        One
                        of the issues was the average experience of specialists, and we’ve got such statistics:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Less than 1 year – 13%</li>
                        <li>1-2 years – 25%</li>
                        <li>3-5 years – 29%</li>
                        <li>6-10 years – 17%</li>
                        <li>10+ years – 12%</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As we can see, the greatest percentage of developers has from 3 to 5 years of experience. Let’s
                        see,
                        what monthly salaries they have depending on the working experience:</p>
                    <li>Junior MEAN stack developer – $600</li>
                    <li> Middle developer – $3500/li>
                    <li>Senior MEAN stack web developer – $6000</li>
                    <p>We took the data from DOU. On this web resource, you can find much valuable information about the
                        IT
                        sphere in Ukraine. The numbers provided above are actual for the capital but they may be smaller
                        in
                        other towns. Also, the salaries will definitely vary from company to company, but you can see
                        the
                        average numbers</p>
                    <h4>MEAN Stack Developer Skills</h4>
                    <p>MEAN stack development implies a deep knowledge of JavaScript. Let’s see what other skills a
                        person
                        should have to be called a MEAN stack developer:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML/CSS/JavaScript. As we’re talking about web application development, a sound knowledge
                            of
                            these
                            technologies is essential.</li>
                        <li>A MEAN stack developer is a full-stack developer, so he should be able to design software
                            architecture, and deeply understand the programming paradigm in general.</li>
                        <li>Knowledge of DevOps tools (continuous integration, continuous delivery, deployment
                            automation).
                            This
                            is not a necessary requirement for a MEAN stack developer, but if the team is working on a
                            large
                            project, sometimes these skills would be useful.</li>
                        <li>Deep understanding of database structure. As full-stack developers work with both backend
                            and
                            frontend, they should be able to design a database and set it up according to particular
                            system
                            requirements.</li>
                        <li>Knowledge of various SDLC models with a focus on Agile development. If the project is
                            lengthy
                            and
                            complicated, Agile methodology is often the best option, because it provides higher
                            flexibility
                            compared to its competitors, and consequently, saves more time and budget.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Speaking of SDLC models, it’s essential to be good at them, because each team has its preferred
                        SDLC
                        approaches, and it can save many resources if a hired specialist understands them from the very
                        beginning.</p>
                    <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
                    <p>We’ll reiterate that the world of technologies changes quickly, and it’s essential to be up to
                        date.
                        For now, full-stack developers are a great solution in terms of the restricted budget and
                        timeframes.

                        There are many technologies that full-stack developers work with, but over the course of time,
                        IT
                        specialists have come to the most optimal set of tools that allows delivering the best possible
                        results. This set is called the MEAN stack, which consists of MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and
                        Node.js.

                        It often happens that you lack people with some specific skills for a particular project. For
                        such
                        cases, there are such options as dedicated developers or a staff augmentation model. They imply
                        that
                        you don’t have to go through a complicated recruitment process to find a person with the
                        knowledge
                        you need. It may be especially undue if you won’t need the specialist when a certain project is
                        over. In such a case, you may want to look for a programmer that will work for you on a
                        temporary
                        basis.

                        Besides, as we’ve already mentioned, hiring a MEAN stack developer may be much more beneficial
                        than
                        hiring four different software developers with knowledge in each technology of the MEAN stack.
